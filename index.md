## Swing Work
This is just my practice work for learning java's swing gui framework, only using a text editor (I cannot stand using IDE's, even for GUI's)
This work is largely useless to anyone but me, I would make it private if I had any private repo's left on github

I'm very bad at variable, class, and method names... I just use whatever I can think of...
